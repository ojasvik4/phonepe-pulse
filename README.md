# phonepe-pulse
The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data and process it to obtain insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner.

Data Extraction: Clone the Phonepe pulse Github repository using git clone command. Load the data into a Pandas dataframe using libraries such as Pandas or csv. Preprocess the data and perform any necessary cleaning and transformation steps.

Database Management: Set up a MySQL database to store the processed data. Connect to the database using mysql-connector-python. Create a table in the database to store the data. Insert the data into the table using SQL commands.

Visualization and Dashboard Creation: Use Streamlit and Plotly libraries to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. Create a user-friendly interface with multiple dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display. Use Plotly's built-in geo map functions to display the data on a map. Use the data in the dataframe to update the dashboard dynamically. Create at least 10 different dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display.

Deployment: Ensure the solution is secure, efficient, and user-friendly. Test the solution thoroughly. Deploy the dashboard publicly, making it accessible to users.
